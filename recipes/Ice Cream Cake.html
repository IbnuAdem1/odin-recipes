    <h2>Descrption</h2>
    <p>An ice cream cake is a nostalgic treat for many. All of us have enjoyed one at a birthday party somewhere. It is the perfect combination of texture: rich, dense cake with cold, sweet ice cream. The dessert is almost irresistible.</p>
<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Cake mix:</b>Start with a store-bought chocolate cake mix. </li>
    <li><b>Water:</b> Add a cup of water to the cake mix. </li>
    <li><bEggs:></b> Three eggs add richness and help bind the batter together. </li>
    <li><b>Oil:</b> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends moisture without adding flavor. </li>
    <li><b>Ice cream:</b> Store-bought chocolate ice cream makes this cake recipe super convenient.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li><b>Step 1:</b>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2:</b>Combine chocolate cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li><b>Step 3:</b>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 26 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wired rack.</li>
    <li><b>Step 4:</b>Meanwhile, remove the carton paper from ice cream. Set ice cream block on its long side. Use a piece of string or dental floss to cut ice cream in half lengthwise, then place the 2 pieces side-by-side on a sheet of waxed paper.</li>
    <li><b>Step 5:</b>Remove cooled cake from the baking dish and place over the ice cream slabs. Trim cake and ice cream, so the edges are flush.</li>
</ol>
